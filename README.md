# Neural-Networks
My journey in Neural networks and Machine learning. I am using this to document my projects and my progression. Feel free to look through :)



# What I have learned
- The basics of using the Keras, tensorflow and pytorch Libary
- Learned the basic strucutre of building a neural network such as Data augmentations including converting raw data into numpy and tensors.
- Knowing the different layers for different types of NNs such as Dense layers and Conv layers.
- Exploring the different loss functions and optimization functions such as Adamn's optimizer and cross entrophy loss.
